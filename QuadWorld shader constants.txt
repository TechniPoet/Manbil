u_mySampler -- custom texture that will be specified by the user when the shader is compiled (if the shader uses it)
u_noiseSampler -- texture containing random noise. Can be specified by the user.

u_elapsed_seconds -- elapsed time since world start, as a float
u_shader_seconds -- elapsed time since shader start, as a float
u_cam_pos -- camera position as a vec3
u_cam_forward -- camera forward vector, as a normalized vec3
u_cam_upward -- camera upward vector, as a normalized vec3
u_cam_sideways -- camera sideways vector, as a normalized vec3

u_cam_width -- width of the screen in pixels, as a float
u_cam_height -- height of the screen in pixels, as a float

out_uv -- UV coordinates for the quad as a vec2 in the range {0, 0} to {1, 1}.

FinalOut_Color -- output color for the fragment shader, as a vec4. Must set this for the shader to be valid.
